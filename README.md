Project: Perfumy - A React-Based E-Commerce Practice Project

Description:
Perfumy is my first React project, designed as a practice task to build a simple e-commerce platform for perfumes. The project focuses on clean, concise code and follows best practices in React development. It includes features like product listing, filtering, and a basic cart system. The project is organized into branches for better version control and to demonstrate incremental development.

Key Features:

Product Listing: Display a list of perfumes with details like name, price, and image.

Code Highlights:

Concise Components: Reusable and modular React components.

State Management: Basic state handling using React hooks (useState, useEffect).

Branching Strategy: Development is divided into branches (e.g., feature/product-listing, feature/cart).

Branches:

main: Stable production-ready code.

Tech Stack:

React
HTML/CSS
JavaScript (ES6+)

This project serves as a foundation for learning React and improving my front-end development skills. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
